            <h1>Welcome to My Portfolio</h1>
            <p>Hey there! I'm Sreeyuth Chowdary, a hardworking computer science major in my first year of university. My journey into the world of technology began with a strong desire to create beautiful web designs in addition to functional ones. I firmly believe that code has the ability to not only make functions come to life but also to produce engaging and visually appealing digital experiences.</p>
            <p><br></p>
            <p>I'm a passionate photographer outside of the lines of code, and I enjoy capturing brief moments with my camera. My passion for the visual arts complements my interest in technology. I love the art of evoking feelings and telling stories via images.</p>
            <p><br></p>
            <p>Along with design and photography, I also have a strong interest in coding. My curiosity and desire for lifelong learning are encouraged by the fine small details of programming languages, problem-solving, and creating solutions.</p>
            <p><br></p>
            <p>The limitless opportunities that the combination of technology, design, and code presents fascinate me as a passionate student. My objective is to become an expert in my field's technical aspects as well as to effortlessly combine creativity and utility to provide digital experiences that have a lasting impression.</p>

    <h2>My Projects</h2>
    <p><strong>Project: Beginner's Task Tracker</strong></p>
    <p>
        Embark on the journey of creating a user-friendly task manager using Python. As a Python enthusiast, I'm diving into the realm of simple application development. This project involves building a basic task tracker that allows users to add, modify, and delete tasks conveniently.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
        Picture this: A clean console interface where you can effortlessly list tasks, add new ones, and maybe even mark them as completed. The magic lies in the simplicityâ€”just what you need as a Python novice.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
        Through this project, I'm unraveling the foundational concepts of Python programming, learning to manipulate data, and crafting a responsive interaction with users. As I shape this task manager, it's not just about managing tasks; it's about learning and evolving as a budding Python developer. So, join me on this coding adventure as we make our way through the world of tasks and Pythonic possibilities! ðŸš€
